<h1>Passwords</h1>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify">Passwords are used on many websites to help protect sensitive information, thats why its important to have strong passwords. An upwards of 1,000,000 passwords 
    are stolen each weak. Common passwords such as 123456, password, or any word from the dictionary are easy to guess. Adding special characters, random 
    capitalization, and numbers to your password makes it significantly harder to guess. For a 10 digit password using only lowercase letters there are 1e+26 
    options but if you take that same 10 digit password and use uppoercase and lowercase letters along with numbers and symbols you get 1e+102, a password that 
    has over a googol different combinations, now imagine how strong your password would be if it had 100 of those characters. Below are some general rules for 
    keeping accounts safe. </p>
<ul style="background-color:white">
    <li>Make sure to use a long password</li><br>
    <li>Use a mixture of upper and lowercase letters</li><br>
    <li>Use numbers and symbols</li><br>
    <li>Change your password every few months</li><br>
    <li>If your account has been acessed by someone other than you, change your password immediately</li><br>
    <li>Don't share your passwords with anybody</li><br>
    <li>Don't reuse your passwords</li><br>
    <li>Don't make your password easy to guess (Simple words)</li><br>
    <li>Use a password manager</li><br>
</ul>
<br>
<p>In order to keep your accounts safe, use the provided password generator (Note: Values over 20 don't always work)</p>
